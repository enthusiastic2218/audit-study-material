# Data and Analytics overview

Balancer offers data about the protocol, accessible through various sources. This data is helpful for understanding the protocol's performance, usage, and trends.

One of the primary sources of data is our [API GraphQL](./data-and-analytics/balancer-api/balancer-api.md) endpoint. This endpoint provides real-time data, making it an excellent resource for those who need up-to-the-minute information about the protocol.

In addition to the API, we also provide a [subgraph](./data-and-analytics/subgraph.md) that indexes the Balancer protocol. This subgraph offers a comprehensive view of the protocol's data, making it easy to analyze and understand the protocol's behavior over time.

Lastly, various [Dune dashboards](/data-and-analytics/data-and-analytics/dune/overview.html) exist. These dashboards provide a visual representation of the protocol's data, making it easy to understand and interpret. They are a great resource for visual data analysis.
