# Developer Reference

For the most common use cases the APIs of interest will be the [Router](./contracts/router-api.md) or the [BatchRouter](./contracts/batch-router-api.md).

We also provide a [JS/TS SDK](./sdk/README.md) to assist with interacting with the Balancer Protocol.

Checkout the [Integrations Guides](../developer-reference/sdk/README.md) for Solidity and Javascript examples on common actions like adding/removing liquidity and making swaps.

Individuals are encouraged to contact our developers via [Discord](https://discord.balancer.fi/) to request further assistance.
