Resources
=================
* Figs: Illustrations is still working on the figs.
** 82 total. 

** Once the figs are processed on /work, you'll need to add them to the book's repo.
** A report mapping original figure file names to their new names can be found in the tools folder for this project as figure_renaming_report.tsv.

* Intake Report:(Atlas repo) tools/intakereport.txt

* MS Snapshot: To view the submitted files, checkout the git tag named 'manuscript_to_prod' by running the following command:

$ git checkout manuscript_to_prod

This will temporarily switch the files in your repo to the state they were in when the manuscript_to_prod tag was created. To switch the files back to the current state, run: 

$ git checkout main 

 Notes from Tools:
=================

* PROD: Add any authors to the project that need to be added.

* Syntax highlighting: applied to 18 out of 187 code listings.

* I added pdf CSS to format the early release contributor names as a twocolumn list. Let me know if we need to do something for the EPUB too.

* There are a number of files in the repository that aren't in the build list. I didn't remove any since it's not always obvious whether they are needed or not (e.g. pulled in via include statements vs. just leftover from the previous edition and no longer used.)

* Please let Tools know ASAP if there are any other global problems for which we can help automate a fix.

Notes at arrival in production:
=================

* OK to remove existing index entries and rename the chapter files with numbers. [DONE]

* Has the known width error in epub that can be fixed by adding XSL. [DONE]

* Some outdated FM boilerplate. Can we make the Early Release contributors list in the preface more compact by putting it in 2 columns? [DONE for pdf, see note above please]

* Please remove existing pagebreaks. [DONE, I think, but a few may have slipped through the check, due to a relatively complicated structure, with include statments in some files]

=================

Please let me know about any other issues.

Thanks,
Theresa
